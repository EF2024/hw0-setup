## Problems

### Environment setup and code implementation (3 points)
Pass test cases by implementing the functions in `code.py`. Each test case is weighted equally to make the overall score (e.g. if you pass 1/2 test cases, you get 1.5 points).

### Free response questions on code (2 points, each question worth 0.2 points) 
Answer the following free response questions in a separate document, saved as a .pdf and **uploaded to Canvas**. You can find these answers on the course homepage.

1. How many total points of extra credit are available? Will there be special extra credit provided to indivudals who ask for it, beyond that provided to the class as a whole? 

2. Explain the Drop One policy.

3. Does the Drop One policy apply to exams? Will we schedule alternate exams on different days for students who request that?

4. Where do you submit the free response answers and in what file format must you submit it?

5. How is your code to be submitted?

6. Will we grade something submitted late (even if it is just 1 minute late) or submitted in the wrong place?

7. If you are not sure you'll be done with an assignment by the deadline, what is a good approach to ensure you'll get points for the work you did complete prior to the deadline?

8. Are you required to do your own coding and to answer your own questions individually on the homework? 

9. Where should you go to find class announcements and post questions?

10. Is attendence graded?
