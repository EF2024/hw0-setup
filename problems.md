## Problems

### Environment setup and code implementation (5 points)
Pass test cases by implementing the functions in `code.py`. Each test case is weighted equally to make the overall score (e.g. if you pass 1/2 test cases, you get 2.5 points).

## Free response questions on code (5 points, each question worth 0.5 points) Answer the following free response questions in a separate document, saved as a .pdf and **uploaded to Canvas**. You can find these answers on the course homepage.

1. How do you run a test case yourself?

2. How do you submit your code to github?

3. Will we use an automated system to check for code duplication?

4. What version of python is required for all homework assignments?

5. Are you required to do your own coding? 

6. Should issues with problematic test cases or code provided to you be raised on Piazza or as an issue in the issue tracker for the GitHub starter code repository?

7. What is the course policy on submitting late assignments?

8. What is the course policy on extra credit?

9. When are the midterm and final exam?
