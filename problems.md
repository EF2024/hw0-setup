## Problems

### Environment setup and code implementation (3 points)
Pass test cases by implementing the functions in `code.py`. Each test case is weighted equally to make the overall score (e.g. if you pass 1/2 test cases, you get 1.5 points).

## Free response questions on code (2 points, each question worth 0.5 points)
